# Data_Science_Challenge_2020_Berufsunfaehigkeit
The study Machine-Learning Methods for Insurance Applications is dedicated to the question of how new developments in the collection of data and their evaluation in the context of Data Science in the actuarial world can be utilized.  The results of the study are based on the R language, so the first goal of this work is to reproduce the calculations described in the Jupyter notebook in the Python programming language and to compare the results with those of the study authors. Besides these presented methods we continue to work on a random forest. Therefore, our second goal is the development of an artificial neural network, which has at least a similar quality compared to the other machine learning methods.

The German Association of Actuaries (Deutsche Aktuarvereinigunge.V., DAV) is the professional representation of all actuaries in Germany. It was founded in 1993 and has more than 5,400 members today. More than 700 members are involved in thirteen committees and in over 60 working groups as a voluntary commitment.

The Actuarial Data Science Committee wants to support actuaries in dealing more with data science issues and machine learning methods and has therefore created a Data Science Challenge in 2020. This notebook was created by Melanie Wahlers und Dr. Johannes Hollad and won the first prize in the group evaluation of the Data Science Challenge 2020.
